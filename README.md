How you implemented TypeScript features and OOP principles.
- I used Vite to set up my project with TypeScript, which made the development process faster and easier. Type script helped me to identify errors easily which made me to write a bug less code. To handle errors better, I created a custom error class by extending the built-in Error class. This helped me apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, making my code more organized and reusable.
  
The challenges you encountered and how you overcame them.
-Some of the project requirements were unclear, especially around calculating discounts and taxes. I struggled with overriding functions in parent and child classes to make the calculations work. It took me a while to figure it out, but eventually, I decided to use simple logic and common sense to get the right results for discounts and tax amounts. 
How you handled asynchronous operations and error management.
- For handling asynchronous tasks, I used the await keyword with the fetch function to get data from an API. To manage errors, I created custom error classes to handle both API errors and data errors. This allowed me to show clear and helpful error messages when something went wrong.
